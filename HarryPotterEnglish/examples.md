> 哈利等待着打击的到来。

## Origin Story

　　Harry waited for the blow to fall.
　　"So..." said Snape softly. "We'll see about this...."
　　He strode across to his fire, seized a fistful of glittering powder from a jar on the fireplace, and threw it into the flames.
　　"Lupin!" Snape called into the fire. "I want a word!"
　　Utterly bewildered, Harry stared at the fire. A large shape had appeared in it, revolving very fast. Seconds later, Professor Lupin was clambering out of the fireplace, brushing ash off his shabby robes.
　　"You called, Severus?" said Lupin mildly.
　　"I certainly did," said Snape, his face contorted with fury as he strode back to his desk. "I have just asked Potter to empty his pockets. He was carrying this."
　　Snape pointed at the parchment, on which the words of Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs were still shining. An odd, closed expression appeared on Lupin's face.
　　"Well?" said Snape.
　　Lupin continued to stare at the map. Harry had the impression that Lupin was doing some very quick thinking.
　　"Well?" said Snape again. "This parchment is plainly full of Dark Magic. This is supposed to be your area of expertise, Lupin. Where do you imagine Potter got such a thing?"
　　Lupin looked up and, by the merest half-glance in Harry's direction, warned him not to interrupt.
　　"Full of Dark Magic?" he repeated mildly. "Do you really think so, Severus? It looks to me as though it is merely a piece of parchment that insults anybody who reads it. Childish, but surely not dangerous? I imagine Harry got it from a joke shop --"
　　"Indeed?" said Snape. His jaw had gone rigid with anger. "You think a joke shop could supply him with such a thing? You don't think it more likely that he got it directly from the manufacturers?"
　　Harry didn't understand what Snape was talking about. Nor, apparently, did Lupin.

> 哈利等待着打击的到来。 “那么……”斯内普轻声说。“我们来看看这个……” 他大步走到壁炉前，从壁炉架上的一罐中抓了一把闪闪发光的粉末，扔进了火焰中。 “卢平！”斯内普对着火焰喊道。“我想和你谈谈！” 哈利完全困惑地盯着火焰。火焰中突然出现了一个大形状，旋转得非常快。几秒钟后，卢平教授从壁炉里爬了出来，拍打着他破旧的袍子上的灰尘。 “你找我，西弗勒斯？”卢平温和地说。 “当然是我找的，”斯内普一边说着，一边带着愤怒的表情走回他的桌子。“我刚刚让波特把他的口袋掏空。他带着这个。” 斯内普指着那张羊皮纸，上面月光夫人、虫尾巴、 Padfoot 和 Prongs 的字迹还在发光。卢平的脸上出现了一种奇怪的、封闭的表情。 “怎么样？”斯内普说。 卢平继续盯着那张地图。哈利觉得卢平正在非常快速地思考。 “怎么样？”斯内普又问。“这张羊皮纸显然充满了黑魔法。这是你的专长，卢平。你认为波特是从哪里得到这样的东西的？” 卢平抬起头，仅仅用半瞥的眼神向哈利的方向示意，警告他不要插嘴。 “充满了黑魔法？”他温和地重复道。“你真的这么想吗，西弗勒斯？在我看来，这只不过是一张侮辱任何阅读它的人的羊皮纸。幼稚，但肯定不危险？我猜想哈利是从一家笑话店得到的——” “确实？”斯内普说。他的下巴因为愤怒而变得僵硬。“你认为一家笑话店能提供给他这样的东西？你不觉得他更有可能是直接从制造商那里得到的吗？” 哈利不明白斯内普在说什么。显然，卢平也不明白。
